// # Examp Two Problem Solving All Questions:)


/* 1. Write a JavaScript function that takes an array and returns the minimum
number of this array using a loop. Ignore the built-in method for finding.
(Mark: 5)
Example:
Input: const numbers = ["10", "21", 3, "14", "53", 55, ”36”, 48];
Output: 3 */




/*
2. Create a JavaScript function that generates a random password with a specified
length. The password should include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase
letters, numbers, and special characters. (Mark: 5)
Character Set :
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%
^&*()"
Example:
Input: generateRandomPassword(8);
Output: “Pas@word” */



/* 3. Write a Javascript function that takes 2 arrays as input. Which are productList
and availableProductInInventory. Your task is to determine which products are
in stock and which are out of stock. (Mark: 5)
Example
Input:
const productList = [
{id: 101, title: "Product 1"},
{id: 102, title: "Product 2"},
{id: 103, title: "Product 3"},
{id: 104, title: "Product 4"}
];
const availableProductInInventory = [102, 104];

Output:
{
inStockProductList: [{id: 102, title: "Product 2"}, {id: 104, title: "Product 4"}],
outOfStockProductList: [{id: 101, title: "Product 1"}, {id: 105, title: "Product 3"}]
} */



/* 4. How do you add or remove properties from an object dynamically two
operations are managed from one function? (Mark: 5) */



/* 5. Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers and returns a
new array with only the even numbers. (Mark: 5)
Example:
Input: const numbers = [10, 21, 3, 14, 53, 55, 36, 48]
Output: [10, 14, 36, 48] */


/* 6. Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of objects and a key, and
returns a new array sorted based on the values of that key in ascending
order. (Mark: 5)
Example:
Input const people = [
{ name: "John", age: 30 },
{ name: "Alice", age: 25 },
{ name: "Bob", age: 35 },
];
const data = myfunction(people, "age");
[
{ name: "Alice", age: 25},
{ name: "John", age: 30 },
{ name: "Bob", age: 35 },
]
 */


/* 7. Write a JavaScript function that takes two sorted arrays and merges them
into a single sorted array without using any built-in sorting functions.
(Mark: 5)
Example:
const arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7];
const arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8];
myfunction(arr1, arr2);
Output: [8,7,5,4,3,2,1]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] */



/* 8. Write a JavaScript class definition for the Product class with a constructor and
the getTotalPrice() method. Additionally, create an instance of the Product
class and calculate its total price (price multiplied by quantity). (Mark: 5)
Assume the following product data:
Product Name: "Laptop"
Price: 1000
Quantity: 3 */
